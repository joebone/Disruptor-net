[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/Disruptor-net/Disruptor-net/_apis/build/status/Default?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/Disruptor-net/Disruptor-net/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)
[![NuGet](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Disruptor)](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Disruptor/)

## Overview

The Disruptor is a high performance inter-thread message passing framework. This project is the .NET port of [LMAX Disruptor](https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor).

The Disruptor can be succinctly defined as a circular queue with a configurable sequence of consumers. The key features are:
- Zero memory allocation after initial setup (the events are pre-allocated).
- Push-based consumers.
- Optionally lock-free.
- Configurable [wait strategies](https://github.com/disruptor-net/Disruptor-net/wiki/Wait-Strategies).

Most of the information from the Java documentation is applicable to the .NET version, especially the [core concepts](https://github.com/LMAX-Exchange/disruptor/wiki/Introduction).

The quickest way to get started with the disruptor is by using the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Disruptor).

## Sample code

First, you need to define your event (message) type:

```cs
public class SampleEvent
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public double Value { get; set; }
}
```

You also need to create a consumer:

```cs
public class SampleEventHandler : IEventHandler<SampleEvent>
{
    public void OnEvent(SampleEvent data, long sequence, bool endOfBatch)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Event: {data.Id} => {data.Value}");
    }
}
```

Then you can setup the Disruptor:

```cs
var disruptor = new Disruptor<SampleEvent>(() => new SampleEvent(), bufferSize: 1024);

disruptor.HandleEventsWith(new SampleEventHandler());

disruptor.Start();
```

Finally, you can publish events:

```cs
using (var scope = disruptor.PublishEvent())
{
    var data = scope.Event();
    data.Id = 42;
    data.Value = 1.1;
}
```

Other event [publication options](https://github.com/disruptor-net/Disruptor-net/wiki/Publication-Options) are described in the Wiki.

## Roadmap

* Include latest changes made to the future Java versions
* Remove exception-based APIs
* Improve documentation

## Build from source and run tests

You may build the Disruptor directly from the source, run `Cake-Build.bat`: it will compile, run the tests and output binaries and results into `\output\assembly` folder
You can also run all the performance tests by running `Cake-Perf.bat`.
